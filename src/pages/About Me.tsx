        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p style={{ maxWidth: '450px' }}>I’m a developer from the Netherlands.
            I’m working on a couple of projects at the moment and have made a lot of different things over the years.
            I’m 18 years old and i started programming in 2020.
            <br /><br />
            I'm really passionate about my projects and i love to put a lot of attention and detail into them.
            <br />
            Most of my projects stem from the things that i'm missing, or feel that could be improved.
            You should be able to see that in the products i've created, such as a password generator, a code snippet manager and more.
            <br /><br />
            I'm always looking for new projects to develop, and when i do they'll be shared here.</p>
